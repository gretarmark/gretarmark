### Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I am an electrical- and computer engineer with specialization in control systems and robotics. 
I currently work as an MATLAB and PLC/PAC programmer. 
I just finished a PID controller simulation for a hydro power plant in Iceland.
Additionally, I performed PLC/PAC programming for a sewerage system using Schneider Modicon M580 Hot Standby Redundant computers and designed the electrical system for the station in EPLAN. 

From my previous study program, I have experience in image analysis using both MATLAB and C++. 
I have also developed control system algorithms in the following subjects:
* Model Predictive Control
* PID
* LQR/LQG
* Adaptive Control
* Robust Control
* Fault-Tolerant Control
