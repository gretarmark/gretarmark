### Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I work as an electrical- and control engineer and develop automation software solutions for industrial control. I leverage tools like Matlab/Simulink to perform data analysis and control simulations. Moreover, I ensure flawless functionality through Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) and System Acceptance Testing (SAT).
